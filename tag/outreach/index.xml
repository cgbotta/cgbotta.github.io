is designed as a step-by-step guide to developing simple Python code that
includes the basic functionalities of molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo
simulations. The main goal is to help users understand the fundamentals of
molecular simulation algorithms. The scripts will also be used for small
scientific projects. In particular, some of the earliest results obtained
from molecular simulations, including the pioneering works by Metropolis,
Rosenbluth, Wood, and Parker in the 1950s, will be re-explored.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you want to take part in the project, reach out to me on
&lt;a href="https://github.com/mdcourse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub&lt;/a>. I am looking for contributors
(co-writers, testers).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This project has received funding from the European Union&amp;rsquo;s Horizon 2020
research and innovation programme under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant
agreement No 101065060.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
