I primarily use molecular simulation, and my background, which combines simulations and experiments, facilitates my collaborations with experimentalists (NMR, neutrons, X-rays). I also dedicate time to creating open and freely accessible educational content for both beginners and experts.\nThe CNRS remains one of the few institutions that guarantees independent research that is not subject to trends—an essential condition for producing critical, open, and long-term knowledge. In this regard, the National Committee plays a fundamental role as a space for scientific collegiality, debate, and counterbalance.\nAs an elected member, I am committed to fully dedicating myself to the National Committee and to contributing to recruitment and evaluation processes in a thoughtful way, not based solely on bibliometric indicators.

Polymers of Intrinsic Microporosity (PIMs) represent a special class with rigid ring-shaped molecules forming interconnected voids of 0.2 to 2 nanometers. PIMs have high specific surface areas and are scalable, making them ideal for gas adsorption and mixture separation. However, only a few fluid mixtures can currently be separated using nanoporous materials, with most methods still relying on costly thermal processes such as distillation. Developing new nanopore-based separation processes could address environmental issues such as water contamination and CO2 emissions. To facilitate the emergence of these new processes, a better understanding of the complex behaviors of nanoconfined fluid mixtures is crucial. Achieving this goal requires novel multiscale approaches to connect the molecular details of confined molecules at the nanoscale to macroscopic transport properties. The aim of this postdoctoral position is to correlate the molecular properties of fluid mixtures in a microporous polymer with its large-scale permeability and selectivity.\nActivities\nDevelopment of realistic models of mixtures in microporous polymers using molecular simulations. Characterization of the structural and dynamic properties of confined fluids and their interactions with polymer surfaces. Upscaling of molecular results to the macroscopic scale using a lattice-based approach. Utilization of the lattice model to predict the macroscopic permeability and selectivity of PIM membranes. Skills\nThe postdoctoral candidate must hold a PhD in physics, statistical mechanics, physical chemistry, or materials science, and have some experience in scientific programming and molecular simulations.\nWork Context\nLIPhy is an interdisciplinary physics laboratory that brings together experts in the theory and experimentation of soft matter systems and fluids at interfaces.
